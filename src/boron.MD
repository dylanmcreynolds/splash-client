## Boron references

**Relevance to M-WET:**

 - Naturally occurring in the environment
	 - Seawater concentration around 5 mg/L [1]
 - Toxicity
	 - boron has an extremely narrow concentration range between deficiency and toxicity in some plants [2] and it has been shown to suppress plant growth [3] and immune response in several crops [4] .
 - Small, neutral solute
	 - Boric acid is a small solute, with an estimated Stokes radius of 1.6 Å [5] , compared to 1.8 Å and 1.2 Å for sodium and chloride, respectively [6] .
	 - The Stokes radius of borate has been estimated as 2.6 Å [7] .

**Physiochemical properties:**
 - Aqueous species include neutral boric acid, negatively-charged borate, and other species in complex waters
	 - The acid dissociation constant, pK a , for boric acid is
	   approximately 9.2 in dilute systems, yet the apparent dissociation constant varies as a function of salinity, temperature, and pressure [8–11] . 
	 - Polyborates [12,13]
	 - Borate-salt complexes [8,10,14]
	 - Organic esters [15,16]

**Analysis**
 - ICP-OES (matt presentation)
 - NEXAFS [17,18]
 - NMR
 - FTIR [19]
